        <h1><strong>My Coding Journey</strong></h1>
        <h2><em>Lets see how much I can learn</em></h2>
        <p>There is so much to learn, it is ablsolutely mindboggling. But it sure beats Plumbing. 
            I am hoping one day to break into the digital world.
            With thid page I can document my journey and try to keep track of everything I have achieved.
        </p>
        <p>I learned how to make ordered and unordered lists (ol and ul).
           I used headings to label each list, but still need to figure out how to keep the size of each the same.
           Or find another way to seperate them. 
           I guess I could use strong or em to label them but the seperation wouldnt be the same.
        </p>
        <p>I have learned how to imbed links into the website using a href, using new and existing tabs(target=blank ref=noopener noreferrer)</p>
        <p>here is a link in this tab to the Odin Links and Images Page <a href="/home/dkxled/repos/odin-links-and-images/index.html">Odin Links and Images</a></p>
        <p>her is the same link but in a new tab<a href="/home/dkxled/repos/odin-links-and-images/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odin Links and Images New Tab</a></p>
